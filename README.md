# Battleship

Battleship Game

Overview

This project is a digital implementation of the classic Battleship game, where players place their ships on a grid and take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships to sink them. It's a two-player game where one player is the human player and the other player is the computer.

Tools Used

JavaScript: The core programming language used for the game logic and interactivity.
HTML/CSS: Used for structuring the user interface and styling elements.
Git: Version control system to manage and track changes in the project.
Visual Studio Code: Integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and debugging code.
Chrome Developer Tools: Used for debugging and inspecting the HTML/CSS/JavaScript during development.

Struggles Encountered

Game Logic Complexity: Implementing the game logic, including ship placement, attacks, and win conditions, required careful planning and testing to ensure accuracy and fairness.
User Interface Design: Designing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, especially for displaying the game boards and ship placements, posed some challenges in terms of layout and responsiveness.
Debugging: Identifying and fixing bugs, especially related to event handling and DOM manipulation, required thorough debugging using browser developer tools and console logs.

Areas for Improvement

Enhanced User Experience: Implementing features such as animations, sound effects, and feedback messages can enhance the overall gaming experience and make it more engaging.
AI Improvement: Enhancing the computer player's AI to make it more strategic and challenging by implementing different difficulty levels or advanced algorithms for ship placement and attack strategies.
Code Refactoring: Refactoring the codebase to improve readability, maintainability, and efficiency by breaking down complex functions into smaller, reusable components and optimizing performance where necessary.
